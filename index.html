                <p> Born in Newport Beach California, I grew up in the sun
                    soaked hills of Santa Clarita. A 5th generation California
                    native, I spent the summers at the beach and the winters skiing. I loved playing sports, video
                    games
                    and
                    reading.
                </p>
                <p>I graduate California State Univeristy, Norhtridge with a BA in History. I moved to Utah in 2013.
                    I
                    currently
                    work at Fidelity Investments with their brokerage operations team.
                </p>
                <p>When I am not working I enjoy the outdoors, playing video games and spening time with my family.
                    I
                    love
                    to
                    try
                    new things, meeting new people and having a good time.
