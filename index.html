            <p> Born in Newport Beach California, I grew up in the sun
                soaked hills of Santa Clarita. A 5th generation California
                native, I spent the summers at the beach and the winters skiing. I loved playing sports, video games and
                reading.
            </p>
            <p>I graduate California State Univeristy, Norhtridge with a BA in History. I moved to Utah in 2013. I
                currently
                work at Fidelity Investments with their brokerage operations team.
            </p>
            <p>When I am not working I enjoy the outdoors, playing video games and spening time with my family. I love
                to
                try
                new things, meeting new people and having a good time.
            </p>
